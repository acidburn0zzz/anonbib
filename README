anonbib 0.2 -- Code to generate the anonymity bibliography

Copyright (c) 2003-2004 Nick Mathewson
Based on 'PDOSBib' perl code by Eddie Kohler

This software is licensed under the GNU GPL, version 2 or later.

To use this software, you need to understand BibTeX and Python a
little. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.  You will need
Python 2.2 or later.

To use this package:
   - Get a good BibTeX file.  You may want to mark it up with some of the
     extra keys used in our "anonbib.bib" file.

   - Edit anonbib.cfg and _template_.html so they refer to your files,
     authors, topics, and so on.
   - Run 'python updateCache.py anonbib.cfg' to create a local cache of the
     papers in your bibliography based on their www_*_url entries.  (By
     default, the script will ignore any entries you have already cached.  To
     force a fresh download of a cached file, delete it.)
   - Run 'python writeHTML.py anonbib.cfg'.  Fix any errors you care about.
   - Re-run these scripts when you change the bibliography.
   - If you want to merge in big BibTeX files, try using the reconcile.py
     script.  See the comment at the start of the file for usage info.
