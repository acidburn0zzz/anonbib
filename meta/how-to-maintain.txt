How to maintain the anonbib / how to make the anonbib maintainable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Keep an eye on the proceedings of conferences where
   anonbib-related papers are often published.  A long time ago, I
   listed a bunch in venue-checklist.txt. Are we missing any papers?

   If you read the paper, do you have any comments on why other
   people should read it? If so, add some notes.


2. When you add papers to anonbib.bib, make sure you include a URL,
   a section, and optionally the 'selected' tag.  Except under
   extreme circumstances, never mark a paper as selected unless it
   is online with some URL.


3. If anybody sends you a paper, add it. Take about 30-60 seconds to
   decide whether it should be 'selected'. Use your judgment.

   If they send you a paper and you can't find it online, ask them
   for a URL, and remind them about "Online or Invisible".

   (EXTRA CREDIT: figure out why the paper wasn't added
   earlier. Should we look at other papers published in the same
   venue? Should we try to find other stuff on the authors' CVs?)


4. If you have done neither 1 nor 3 in the last 3 months, it is
   bad form to add papers that you co-wrote.


5. EXTRA CREDIT: when you add/read a paper, look at its bibliography
   and related works section and see if we're missing anything.


6. EXTRA CREDIT: When you write a paper, look to see whether there's
   anything in your bibliography that isn't in anonbib and should
   be.


Things we need to do to make anonbib functional.
-------------------------------------------------

1. We need more people doing the above stuff. Historically, grad
   students who are trying to catch up on the whole field are pretty
   productive here, since they are doing this kind of stuff anyway.

2. We need the website-rebuild process to be more functional and
   automated. A cronjob or a commit hook would be fine here.

3. We need to decide whether to move to git{hub,lab}, or whether to
   give torproject LDAP accounts to everybody who needs commit
   rights.

4. Perhaps a code rewrite; my 2003 Python is pretty janky!
